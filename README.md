# Mouspike - Coming soon page
Conceptual and technical prototype (*funtional sketch*).

# Descriprion
This project is a conceptual and technical prototype for my brand Mouspike this web prototype represents an early functinal "sketch" created before building the official Shopify website.

This page is not the final or official website, it was created as a first step to visually and technically explore how the brand should look, feel, and communicate before launching the full platform.

The goal of this project was not to sell products yet, but to validate ideas and turn an abstract vision into something real and structured in a coherent vision.

# Purpose of this project 
This coming soon page was used to:

Validate the brand identity.

Explore page structure and layout.

Define the tone and the visual language.

Test visual hierarchy and message placement.

Create a clear direction before building the full shopify website version.

This project helped transform ideas into a clear base that could later be improved and rebuilt at a higher level.

# Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Visual Studio Code (VS code)

this project focuses mainly on front-end structure and design logic.

# Project structure 
[index.html] Main page structure.

[style.css] Layout and visual styling.

[script.js] Small interactive behavior.

[assets/] Images and media files.

# Current status 
This is a front-end only project, the email form does not store data yet, and its not backend connected at this stage, the focused is on design, structure, and clarity of the brand message.
(*The backend logic for email collection is planned and explained separately in another repository.*)

# My role and learning 
This project was fully ideated, structured, and implemented by me as part of my personal brand development process. I was responsible for defining the concept, structure, visual direction, programed and how the ideas were translated into a working front-end prototype.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of front-end structure, visual hierarchy, and how design decisions turn into real technical implementation. It also helped me understand how early prototypes can guide better decisions before building a full platform.

# What exists today
The public coming soon page which is currently active at shopify store (under development) that website has official custom domains, and brand identity already defined and registered.
This project works as a bridge between the idea phase and the full implementation phase.

# What come next
In future stages, this project will evolve into:

A future full rebuilt with a stronger technical foundation, deeper storytelling and brand lore, and added more interactive elements but the most important stage will be a future AI assitant concept to help users understand the brand universe, (concept idea only, not a technical promise at this stage).
