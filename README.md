# Project Overview
This project is a conceptual and technical prototype for my brand Mouspike. This web page was created before building the official Shopify website.

The goal of this project was not to sell products yet, but to validate ideas and transform an abstract vision into a structured front-end experience while testing early interest.

# Purpose 
This prototype was used to:

Explore brand identity and visual language.

Test structure, layout, hierarchy and message clarity.

Create a direction before building the full Shopify implementation.

This project helped transform ideas into a clear base that could later be improved and rebuilt at a higher level.

# Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

# Project structure 
- [index.html](index.html) – Main page structure
- [style.css](style.css) – Layout and visual styling
- [script.js](script.js) – Small interactive behavior
- [assets/](assets/) – Images and media files
- [docs/](docs/) – Project documentation and illustration brief

# Current Status 
This repository represents the front-end prototype.
The email form is connected to a separate backend system for early access email capture, persistence, and notifications.  
The back-end implementation is documented and deployed in a separate repository (Repo 2(Mouspike-early-access-backend
)).

# My Role and Learning 
This project was fully ideated, structured, and implemented by me as part of my personal brand development process. I was responsible for defining the concept, structure, visual direction, programming, and how the ideas were translated into a working front-end prototype.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of front-end structure, visual hierarchy, and how design decisions turn into real technical implementation. It also helped me understand how early prototypes can guide better decisions before building a full platform.

# What Exists Today
The public coming soon page, which is currently active on the Shopify store (under development), using the official registered domains. This repository represents the conceptual and technical bridge between the idea phase and the full platform implementation.

# What Comes Next
In future stages, this project will evolve into:

A future full rebuilt with a stronger technical foundation, deeper storytelling and brand lore, and added more interactive elements but the most important stage will be a future AI assistant concept to help users understand the brand universe.

# Professional Illustration Brief

As part of the coming soon page development, a detailed professional illustration brief
was created for me to communicate technical, visual, and narrative requirements to an external illustrator.

The brief defines:
- Visual mood and symbolic direction
- Technical constraints for a vertical scrolling web illustration
- Layering requirements for future animation and responsive adaptation
- Clear separation between conceptual reference and final artistic freedom

This document reflects how abstract brand ideas were translated into concrete,
technical instructions suitable for real-world production.

A professional illustrator later translated this conceptual direction into cohesive, original artwork, refining composition, consistency, textures and visual storytelling.

The design direction, page structure, visual hierarchy and narrative flow of the landing page were fully defined by me.

# Concept Exploration (AI-assited sketches)

Early visual sketches were generated using AI tools as part of the concept exploration phase.
These images were not used as final assets.
They served to:
- Test mood, composition, and symbolic elements.
- Explore atmosphere and visual hierarchy.
- Support communication with the illustrator during the briefing phase.
- Concept exploration (sketch-01,02:) minimal identity and messaging.
- Concept exploration (sketch-03,04:) introduction of narrative elements.
- Concept exploration (sketch-05,06:) refined atmosphere and final direction.

AI-generated images were used only as a visual exploration tool during early ideation. I provided detailed instructions, iterations and refinements to guide these explorations. These images were never considered final assets.
